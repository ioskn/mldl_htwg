    "## Simple CNN for Edgelovers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you train a very simple CNN with only 1 kernel to discriminate images containing vertical (y=0) from those containing horizontal stripes (y=1). You can use keras for the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](ch02_2.20_kernel.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### a)  Generation of the data\n",
    "Write a function which creates an artficially dataset of greyscale images (50x50 pixel) with 10 vertical or horizontal bars (10 pixel long). Use this function to create a training and validation dataset of 1000 examples each.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b) Build the simplest possible CNN\n",
    "Make a CNN with one convolution (5x5, haveing two outputs (one for horizontal, one for vertical). Train the CNN on the data from a). You should have no more than 30 trainable parameters in the network. \n",
    "* Plot the learning curves: (epochs vs training loss and validation loss) and epochs vs accuracy.You should get an accuracy of approximatly 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Use the max-pooling operation in a clever way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### c) Visualize the learned kernel\n",
    "Visualize the learned kernel, you might want to use `model.get_weights()`. Does the learned kernel makes sense?"
